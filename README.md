#### Delivery Driver is made using unity. The goal is to collect all the packages (small boxes), and deliver them to their corresponding locations (big boxes), depending on their color. Instructions to play Delivery Driver, controls and contribution details are listed down below.

## Controls
Arrow keys control your car, and packages are automatically dropped and collected!
